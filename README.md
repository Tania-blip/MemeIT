# Frontend Development
  - Implemented a dynamic navigation bar with "Login" and "Create Account" buttons, using local storage to toggle visibility based on user authentication status. Ensured persistent visibility while scrolling.
  - Created modal interfaces for Login and Create Account with shadow effects and close functionality, redirecting users to a logged-in state uopn form submission.
  - Enabled meme uploading through a form supporting both drop and click-to-select methods, while restricting file types to images only(.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif).

# Backend Development
  - Designed database schemas for users and memes.
  - Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for meme management, ensuring a robust and interactive user experience.
  - Enforced input validation across various fields such as email, username, password, and meme descriptions to ensure data integrity and alignment with project specifications.

## This project showcases my proficiency in full-stack web development, employing technologies like React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Postman for API testing. My role involved developing dynamic and responsive user interfaces, ensuring secure and efficient data handling, and contributing to all stages of the project lifecycle from conception to deployment.
